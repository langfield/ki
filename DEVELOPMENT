Python package `ki` is a command-line interface for the version control and
editing of ``.anki2`` collections as git repositories of markdown files.
Rather than providing an interactive UI like the Anki desktop client, `ki` aims
to allow natural editing *in the filesystem*.

In general, the purpose of `ki` is to allow users to work on large, complex
Anki decks in exactly the same way they work on large, complex software
projects.

- Fix the following issue: since the location of card files within a ki
  repository has semantic significance, i.e. determines which deck they are in,
  it is important that we preserve the information of where symlinks live.
  However, when we are pushing, it is possible that because of the
  `Path.resolve()` calls littered everywhere, we are instead seeing that all
  cards are in a single deck, because they all resolve to the location of the
  note file corresponding to the first cid processed in the clone operation. A
  test should be written for this.

  (DONE)
- Add a full suite of submodule tests. (DONE)
- Test that adding completely foreign models works as expected. (DONE)
- Add tests for handling of Anki's `Default` deck. Anki does some weird magic
  with the `Default` deck. If it has subdecks, but no cards directly belong to
  `Default`, then it appears to be removed from the tree. Ki should remove it
  as well during pushes if necessary, so that after a `pull()` or `push()` the
  directory tree structure *always* matches the deck tree structure. See e.g.
  `fn hide_default_deck` and `fn remove_single_deck` in
  `rslib/src/decks/tree.rs`.
- Test that the directory within which a card resides is meaningful. So moving
  a card should change its deck. This will require removing the `deck` field
  from the grammar, which is good. We can just replace spaces with hyphens in
  any decks we upload to github, and it will still look reasonably nice. (DONE)
- Make DB error shorter. Should just say 'database is locked'.
- Refactor error message display logic. (DONE)
- Test that models are not duplicated unnecessarily (see bug #14). (DONE)
- Start using GitHub issues.
- Serious bug: push logic is broken. The following sequence is an MWE:
  CLONE
  delete a note
  PUSH
  add note back inside anki
  PULL
  delete note again
  PUSH

  Before this last PUSH, the note exists inside anki. We've deleted it in our
  repo, and committed the deletion, so when we push, the note should be gone
  inside anki. But this is not what happens. Instead, it says `up to date`.
  This is because `diff_repos()` takes the diff between the commit of our last
  PUSH, at which point the note had been deleted, and the current HEAD, at
  which point the note is *also* deleted. This is WRONG. What is the actual
  diff we want? We want the diff between the REMOTE and the HEAD, and the
  REMOTE is just the Anki collection as it sits on disk. Updates may have been
  made to it since the last PUSH, and if we pull those changes, and then revert
  them, these reversions will not "take", because there is no change between
  the state at last PUSH and the state at current HEAD. And updates aren't
  rejected because we just PULLed. So in order for the diff to be correct, we
  must get a temp repo reset to LAST PUSH COMMIT REF, and then pull the remote
  into that. Then our temp repo will have exactly the same state as the remote,
  and we can diff that against the current HEAD. (DONE)
- Test that '.ki/no_submodules_tree' does not, itself, have a '.ki/' directory.
  (NO)
- Test that deleting a deck directory deletes the deck, i.e. there isn't an
  empty folder left in the Anki client after pushing.
- Test that changing models but leaving cards untouched doesn't result in 'up
  to date.'.
- Test that deleting notetypes from models file actually removes them.
- Consider making each model a file, and then making `_models` a directory.
  Then we can safely symlink all the models in deck directories to the
  top-level `_models/` directory, and then just resolve the symlinks when we
  need to push a submodule to github.
- There is a bug where pushes are not no-ops when they should be as a result of
  having submodules whose repository name is different from the deck name.

  Specifically, if you have add a submodule called `a` but its top-level deck
  is called `b`, then once pushed, every push will be nontrivial, because it
  will look like a path rename. (DONE)
- Ki fails to pull deletions. If we:
    CLONE
    Delete a note in Anki
    PULL
  The note is still there in the repo.

  The problem is that `git merge --strategy-option=theirs` doesn't actually use
  `theirs` for everything. To do that, we'd need `git merge --strategy=theirs`,
  but there is no such thing. See
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/173919/is-there-a-theirs-version-of-git-merge-s-ours

Mapping database changes to submodules
--------------------------------------
To fix #18, one option is to use git diff to save a patch for the diff from
HEAD~1 to HEAD. Then for each extant submodule, filter the patches relevant to
that repo, ltrim the paths so they begin at the root of the submodule, and
apply them to the submodules directly. If submodules have been renamed since
the last push, then we can construct a map to the new names. The cases we must
treat are directories that have been converted into submodules, submodules that
have been converted into directories, and submodules that have been renamed. As
a special case of the second, we have submodules that have been deleted. This
is the most common use case. Most users will not be creating shared decks.
Git's default behavior works well for this case. For the case of converting
directories into submodules, we simply check if any extant submodules have the
exact same path as a directory with changes. If so, we use patches. This case
is covered by the fix described above. If submodules have been renamed, well,
we only worry about this case, actually we choose to not worry about this case.
Git's default behavior will be to do whatever it does when you pull changes to
a directory which has been renamed. We should prioritize using ort over
subtree.

To fix the 'not our ref' error during submodule fetch, we must do the
following:

  cd <sm>/ && git log --oneline --graph && git branch temp && \
  git checkout main && git merge --strategy-option=theirs temp


Won't fix
---------
pdoc3 doesn't generate docstrings for click commands
Clone doesn't work on ankiweb deck URLs
Comments aren't supported in notes
Implicitly adding new notetypes is not allowed, currently they cannot be added
  from ki at all, and in the future it should probably require explicitly
  creating a template/model file
Can't map back from HTML to plaintext/markdown while preserving changes made in
  Anki. Editing the files directly is not the main use case. Nice serialization
  and ability to put notes on github is. Mapping back from HTML is impossible
  in the general case, and it adds needless complexity.


Pulling remote changes from GitHub decks while preserving review data
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Consider the following scenario:
- User A clones their collection into a ki repository. All the nids in the note
  files are the nids generated by their Anki installation.
- User A converts their `C* Algebras` deck into a submodule in their
  repository, and pushes this repo to GitHub.
- User B clones their collection, and then clones User A's `C-star-algebras`
  GitHub repo into their ki repository as a submodule. New nids are generated
  for all the notes in this deck, since User B's Anki installation does not
  recognize the nids generated by User A's Anki installation, which are still
  listed in all the note files on GitHub. These new nids are committed to the
  submodule by ki.
- User B studies these notes, accumulating review data.
- User A pushes commits to their `C-star-algebras` GitHub repo, which contain
  important corrections to errata in the deck.
- User B wants these corrections, so they run `git pull` within their submodule
  inside their ki repository. Their branch has diverged from the remote, since
  ki automatically committed the nid reassignments. The merge likely succeeds
  because the line where the nid is defined within each note will not have
  changed within User A's local copy of the repository, since they're still
  using the same nid for that note.
- User B corrects some errata in their local copy of the `C* Algebras` deck
  from within Anki. They want to push their corrections back to User A's GitHub
  repo. They make a pull request with their corrections, but the diff is
  *HUGE*, because the nid for every single note has been changed. This is not
  ideal, because they will have to manually go in and remove the nid changes,
  perhaps with some git wizardry. In particular, they would have to construct a
  branch without the nid reassignment commit.

After thinking about the problem at length, this does not seem to be a
critically high priority issue. Although annoying, it will not cause the
collaboration workflow to be prohibitively cumbersome.

It should still be fixed long-term, however. One possible solution is replacing
the `nid` field within the note grammar with a `uuid` field. There would exist
a `.ki/manifest.yaml` file, which would map uuids to nids. This manifest file
would be unique to each user/Anki installation, whereas the uuid for that
particular note would be somethat that is unique across all users studying that
note (e.g. if it resided in a collaborative deck hosted on GitHub). During a
clone operation, a uuid would be generated for each note, perhaps seeded with a
hash of the note's content. Then the manifest file would be generated, which,
as we mentioned above, would simply map uuids to nids. The uuids would live in
the note files, and then there would be no need to worry about different
people's nids when merging pull requests on GitHub. Everyone would have the
same uuid for a given note. We now have a very simple condition for when an nid
must be regenerated: this must be done whenever we parse a uuid from a note
that does not exist in the manifest yet.


On the deleted notes repo
-------------------------
This is only used to examine the diff between the last push commit ref and the
current HEAD. This diff is used to see which files were deleted, and to be able
to read these files even though they were removed from the repository. This is
done with some reset --hard magic. We want to read these deleted files to
figure out what nids were extant at the last push commit ref. But this is a
very bad way to do this. A simpler thing is to just store the nids that are
currently extant every time we push in a file called ``.ki/last_push_nids``.
Then we simply read these and take the diff against the currently extant nids,
and see which ones were deleted, and remove them with an ``a.col`` call.

This is slow though, because you must read every note on every ki command.
Better to use git to get the diffs, and to do that, we need to use a deleted
notes repo.

On pushing new notes
--------------------
We must use nids as the filename so that edits to fields don't require edits to
the filenames as well. The only other alternative so far is doing
one-file-per-deck.

So what happens when you add a new note?

- Create new md file.
- Add content, add an nid or leave it blank.
- Call push()

    - Ki asks anki to generate a new nid for this note.
    - Changed are pushed to collection.
    - Ki stashes unstaged and staged files
      (git stash -u --keep-index && git reset --hard HEAD).
    - Ki renames file to reflect new nid and changes nid in file.

        - If a new nid must be generated, we first delete the file containing
          that note.
        - Then we regenerate the file (may contain multiple notes) from a
          representation (list of notemaps) saved during push() call.

            - In order to regenerate the file, we must keep track of which
              notes we generated new nids for.
            - For these notes, we must edit the ``notemap`` to have the correct
              ``nid``, and then serialize all the notemaps for that file and
              regenerate the markdown.

        - The order of notes in a file is deterministic, and the filename
          generated is the nid of the first note.

    - Ki commits these changes.
    - Ki recovers the stashed files (git stash pop).

So what happens when you modify an existing nid?

BAD THINGS! YOU LOSE YOUR REVIEW DATA!!
We'll add warning when the nid is generated not to mess with it.

If the user copies the text of a note and doesn't remove the ki-generated nid
stuff, then ki will use some variant of edit distance to figure out which is
the original.

If the user changes the nid of an existing note to something else, then on the
next push, ki will treat it like a new note and generate a new nid for it. The
review/learning data will be lost (can be recovered by reverting to an earlier
commit and pushing again).

We are effectively reimplementing functionality that git can already handle.
The `nid` is to anki what a `filename` is to git.

So the ``apy`` spec for a note looks like this:

    # Note
    nid: 1645010162168
    model: Basic
    tags:
    markdown: false

    ## Front
    a

    ## Back
    b

And our modified spec looks similar to this:


    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@~~~ki~~~@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
    @@@ # WARNING: DO NOT EDIT DATA IN THIS SECTION!
    @@@
    @@@ nid: 1645010162168
    @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@~~~ki~~~@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

    ---

    # Note
    model: Basic
    tags:
    markdown: false

    ## Front
    a

    ## Back
    b

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.  Note names not generated in fixed order. Caused merge conflict for every note.

4.  We loop over all note files 4 times, but we should not do this at all. We
    should ask git which files have changed since the last pull, and only update
    those.

5.  KeyError in push:

10. Note parse errors should not be silent.

11. Deletion of 'anki' git remote and write to hashes file should be in a
    'finally' block. In particular, they should happen if we get a merge conflict:

14. This should indicate that Anki might just have been left open.

  Unexpected SQLite3 error while attempting to acquire lock on file:
  '/home/user/.local/share/Anki2/User 2/collection.anki2':

   A 'sqlite3.DatabaseError' was raised with error message: 'database
   is locked'. This may indicate that either the database file at the
   location specified above is corrupted, or the config file at
   '.ki/config' is pointing to the wrong location. (The latter may occur
   in the unlikely event that the collection file in the Anki data
   directory has been accidentally overwritten.)


15. Models are duplicated when they shouldn't be:
    (Try hashing).

On making push faster
---------------------
We only want to update notes in the SQLite DB that have changed since the last
time we fetched from the remote, i.e. from the local Anki desktop client.

The only times we fetch are when we clone, or when we pull.

We have already handled the case where we pulled.

We must now make sure we don't include anything that was written in the initial
clone call.

Merge conflicts
---------------
When you pull, ki clones a new ephemeral repository and commits its contents.
Then it git pulls from this repo. If there are any changes to the remote, this
will always cause a merge conflict. This is because the current branch and the
ephemeral branch have completely unrelated histories.

One possible solution is to clone the commit of the last successful pull, and
then clone an ephemeral repo and pull the ephem into that last-pull-commit
repo, forcing merge conflict resolution with --theirs. Then we can pull this
repo into the main ki repo, and the merge conflicts should be gone because
there is now a shared history.
